The use of data mining techniques in agricultural research is highly regarded. The 
key contributing variables to increasing yields in agriculture include weather, rain, soil, pesticides, and fertilizers. The soil is the most important component 
of agriculture for growing crops. An important aspect of soil asset management in 
horticulture is the examination of the soil. The soil investigation is very helpful
for cultivators to determine what kind of harvests should be grown in a particular 
soil condition. Investigating soil supplements using data mining categorization 
algorithms is the main goal of this effort. From the Department of Agriculture, 
Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, a sizable data set of soil nutrient status was 
gathered.The database contains the measurement of soil nutrients for all different
states. This study examines the soil nutrients in a few Tamil Nadu districts in
India. The soil of distinctive type contains a wide range of additives. This study
uses a hybrid approach of neural networks to examine the nutrients nitrogen, 
phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, iron, and zinc in soil 
supplements. The accuracy and execution time of the classification algorithms are 
compared in order to assess their performance.
